# Masterthesis_textmining
Some python-scripts used as support during the qualitative analyses of the problem-centered interviews during my master thesis


During my thesis i used some limited forms of textmining, primarily as a additional source of information for coding text segments and to test the possibilities and limitations of natural language processing with pretrained models on a small number of interviews. If you want to learn mor, you better look up these articles from "Towards datascience" and media:
